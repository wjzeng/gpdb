    <p>Greenplum Database provides utilities that you can use to migrate data between Greenplum
      Database systems.</p>
    <p otherprops="pivotal">The <codeph><xref href="../../utility_guide/admin_utilities/gpcopy.xml"
          >gpcopy</xref></codeph> utility can migrate data between Greenplum Database systems
      running software version 5.9.0 or later. The utility can require less disk space to migrate
      between Greenplum Database systems that co-exist on the same hosts. </p>

      installations running any 5.x version software.
